# GA4GH WES Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Federated Imputation System now fully supports GA4GH WES (Workflow Execution Service) API alongside Michigan Imputation Server API.

## Live GA4GH Services Configured

### 1. eLwazi Node Imputation Service
- **URL**: http://elwazi-node.icermali.org:6000/ga4gh/wes/v1
- **Status**: ✓ Active
- **Workflow Engines**: Nextflow (NFL) 22.10.0, Snakemake (SMK) 6.10.0
- **Total Jobs**: 6
- **Supported Protocols**: file, S3

### 2. ILIFU GA4GH Starter Kit
- **URL**: http://ga4gh-starter-kit.ilifu.ac.za:6000/ga4gh/wes/v1
- **Status**: ✓ Active
- **Workflow Engines**: Nextflow (NFL) 22.10.0, Snakemake (SMK) 6.10.0
- **Total Jobs**: 2
- **Supported Protocols**: file, S3

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Admin Service Setup
- Custom setup wizard for configuring services
- Support for two API types:
  - Michigan Imputation Server API
  - GA4GH WES API
- Test connection functionality
- API-specific configuration

### 2. GA4GH WES Integration
- Proper handling of `/service-info` endpoint
- Extraction of workflow engine information
- System state monitoring (job counts)
- Support for multiple workflow engines

### 3. Reference Panel Management
- For GA4GH services, panels represent workflows
- Each workflow engine can have its own imputation pipeline
- Automatic panel syncing from service metadata

### 4. Service Testing
- Real-time connection testing
- Display of service capabilities
- Error handling and reporting

## API Endpoints

### GA4GH WES Standard Endpoints
- `/service-info` - Service metadata and capabilities
- `/runs` - Submit and list workflow runs
- `/runs/{run_id}` - Get run details
- `/runs/{run_id}/status` - Get run status
- `/runs/{run_id}/cancel` - Cancel a run

## Usage

### Quick Setup
```bash
# Set up example services
docker-compose exec web python manage.py setup_example_services
```

### Manual Setup
1. Go to Admin → Imputation services
2. Click "Add Service (Setup Wizard)"
3. Select API Type: "GA4GH Service Info"
4. Enter service URL (without /service-info)
5. Test connection
6. Save

### Testing Connection
The "Test Connection" button will:
- Verify the service is reachable
- Display workflow engines
- Show job statistics
- Confirm WES API version

## Technical Details

### Service Discovery
The system automatically:
- Appends `/service-info` to base URLs
- Handles URLs that already include `/service-info`
- Extracts workflow engine versions
- Identifies supported file protocols

### Workflow Integration
GA4GH WES services use workflows instead of traditional reference panels:
- Nextflow workflows for pipeline execution
- Snakemake workflows as alternatives
- Each workflow can have different parameters
- Reference panels become workflow parameters

## Benefits

1. **Standardization**: Uses GA4GH standard API
2. **Flexibility**: Supports multiple workflow engines
3. **Scalability**: Can integrate with any GA4GH WES service
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time job statistics
5. **Interoperability**: Works with GA4GH ecosystem

## Future Enhancements

1. Workflow parameter extraction
2. Real-time job monitoring
3. Workflow submission interface
4. S3 file upload support
5. Advanced workflow configuration
