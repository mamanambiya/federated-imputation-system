# Job Submission Fix - Complete Solution

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Issue:** Job submission was failing with "Failed to submit job. Please try again"

---

## Problem Summary

Job submission through the web interface was failing with HTTP 422 "Field required" errors, even though all fields were being sent by the frontend.

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by a combination of problems in the microservices architecture:

1. **Trailing Slash Redirect**: FastAPI automatically redirects requests from `/jobs/` to `/jobs` with HTTP 307
2. **Form Data Loss**: During HTTP redirects, multipart form data (including files) is dropped by the HTTP client for security reasons
3. **Incorrect Form Handling**: The API gateway was passing file objects instead of reading file contents
4. **Container Management**: Docker `restart` command doesn't pick up new images

### Technical Flow of the Bug

```
Frontend → API Gateway → Job Processor
  POST /api/jobs/
  (with form data)
                ↓
            POST /jobs/  → 307 Redirect → POST /jobs
            (form data)    (form data     (EMPTY!)
                            LOST here)
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. API Gateway Changes (`microservices/api-gateway/main.py`)

#### Fix 1: Proper Form Data Reading
**Location:** Lines 322-333

Changed from:
```python
files = {key: (file.filename, file.file, file.content_type)
        for key, file in form.items() if hasattr(file, 'file')}
```

To:
```python
for key, value in form.items():
    if hasattr(value, 'file'):
        # Read file contents into memory
        files[key] = (value.filename, await value.read(), value.content_type)
    else:
        # Regular form field
        json_data[key] = value
```

**Why:** The file object's `.file` attribute isn't suitable for forwarding. We need to read the actual bytes.

#### Fix 2: Use `data` Parameter for Multipart Requests
**Location:** Lines 173-182

Changed from:
```python
response = await self.client.request(
    method=method,
    url=url,
    json=json_data,  # WRONG for multipart
    files=files
)
```

To:
```python
if files:
    response = await self.client.request(
        method=method,
        url=url,
        data=json_data,  # Correct for form fields with files
        files=files,
        follow_redirects=False
    )
```

**Why:** When sending files, form fields must use `data` parameter, not `json`.

#### Fix 3: Strip Trailing Slashes
**Location:** Lines 163-167

```python
service_url = SERVICES[service_name]
# Strip trailing slash to avoid FastAPI redirects
clean_path = path.rstrip('/') if path != '/' else '/'
url = f"{service_url}{clean_path}"
```

**Why:** Prevents triggering FastAPI's 307 redirect that loses form data.

#### Fix 4: Disable Redirect Following
**Location:** Lines 147, 181, 191

```python
self.client = httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=30.0, follow_redirects=False)
# Also in each request call:
follow_redirects=False
```

**Why:** Even if a redirect occurs, don't follow it automatically.

### 2. Job Processor Changes (`microservices/job-processor/main.py`)

#### Fix: Accept Both Path Variants
**Location:** Lines 340-342

```python
@app.post("/jobs/", response_model=JobResponse)
@app.post("/jobs", response_model=JobResponse)
async def create_job(...):
```

**Why:** Provides fallback in case both path variants are used.

#### Fix: Disable Redirect Slashes
**Location:** Lines 142-147

```python
app = FastAPI(
    title="Job Processing Service",
    description="Job lifecycle management and execution",
    version="1.0.0",
    redirect_slashes=False  # Prevent automatic redirects
)
```

**Why:** Disables FastAPI's automatic slash redirect behavior.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Rebuild API Gateway
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/federated-imputation-central/microservices/api-gateway
sudo docker build -t federated-imputation-api-gateway:latest .
```

### 2. Rebuild Job Processor
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/federated-imputation-central/microservices/job-processor
sudo docker build -t federated-imputation-central_job-processor:latest .
```

### 3. Recreate Containers (IMPORTANT!)
**Don't use `docker restart` - it won't pick up new images!**

```bash
# Stop and remove old API gateway container
sudo docker stop api-gateway
sudo docker rm api-gateway

# Create new container with updated image
sudo docker run -d \
  --name api-gateway \
  --network microservices-network \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -e REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379 \
  federated-imputation-api-gateway:latest

# Restart job processor
sudo docker stop job-processor
sudo docker rm job-processor
sudo docker run -d \
  --name job-processor \
  --network microservices-network \
  -p 8003:8003 \
  federated-imputation-central_job-processor:latest
```

### 4. Restart Frontend (to pick up any changes)
```bash
sudo docker restart frontend
```

## Verification

### Test 1: Direct Job Processor Test
```bash
curl -X POST http://154.114.10.123:8003/jobs \
  -F "name=test" \
  -F "service_id=1" \
  -F "reference_panel_id=1" \
  -F "input_format=vcf" \
  -F "build=hg38" \
  -F "phasing=true" \
  -F "input_file=@/path/to/file.vcf.gz"
```

**Expected:** `{"detail":"Service '1' not found..."}` (form data received successfully)
**Not:** `{"detail":[{"type":"missing","loc":["body","name"]...}]}` (form data lost)

### Test 2: Through API Gateway
```bash
curl -X POST http://154.114.10.123:8000/api/jobs/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "name=test" \
  -F "service_id=1" \
  -F "reference_panel_id=1" \
  -F "input_format=vcf" \
  -F "build=hg38" \
  -F "phasing=true" \
  -F "input_file=@/path/to/file.vcf.gz"
```

**Expected:** Same as Test 1 (form data forwarded correctly)

### Test 3: Browser Test
1. Navigate to `http://154.114.10.123:3000/jobs/new`
2. Complete all 4 steps of job submission wizard
3. Click "Submit Job"

**Expected:** Job is created successfully (or appropriate error if services aren't configured)
**Not:** "Failed to submit job. Please try again."

### Logs to Check
```bash
# Should show path stripping working:
sudo docker logs api-gateway 2>&1 | grep "FORWARD"
# Output: WARNING:main:🔍 FORWARD: original_path='/jobs', clean_path='/jobs', url='http://job-processor:8003/jobs'

# Should show NO 307 redirects:
sudo docker logs api-gateway 2>&1 | grep "307"
# Output: (nothing)

# Should show successful POST to /jobs (not /jobs/):
sudo docker logs api-gateway 2>&1 | grep "POST.*jobs"
# Output: INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST http://job-processor:8003/jobs "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found"
#         (or 200/422 depending on service availability)
```

## Key Learnings

### Why HTTP Redirects Lose Form Data

HTTP specifications (RFC 7231) state that clients SHOULD NOT automatically redirect POST requests with request bodies. Most HTTP clients (including httpx, curl, browsers) implement this by:

1. Following the redirect
2. Changing POST to GET, OR
3. Dropping the request body

This is a security feature to prevent accidentally sending sensitive data to a different endpoint.

### FastAPI Trailing Slash Behavior

FastAPI automatically redirects:
- `/endpoint/` → `/endpoint` (if only `/endpoint` is defined)
- `/endpoint` → `/endpoint/` (if only `/endpoint/` is defined)

This is helpful for HTML pages but problematic for APIs with file uploads.

### Docker Container vs Image Updates

- `docker restart CONTAINER` - Restarts existing container (same image)
- `docker stop` + `docker rm` + `docker run` - Creates new container with latest image

After rebuilding an image with `docker build`, you MUST recreate containers to use the new image.

## Files Modified

1. **microservices/api-gateway/main.py**
   - Lines 147: Set `follow_redirects=False` in httpx client
   - Lines 163-167: Add path stripping logic
   - Lines 173-192: Fix form data handling and use `data` parameter
   - Lines 322-333: Read file contents with `await value.read()`

2. **microservices/job-processor/main.py**
   - Lines 142-147: Add `redirect_slashes=False` to FastAPI app
   - Lines 340-342: Add both `/jobs/` and `/jobs` endpoint decorators

3. **Frontend** (`frontend/src/pages/NewJob.tsx`)
   - No changes required (was already correct)

---

## Status

✅ **RESOLVED** - Job submission now works correctly through the web interface.

Form data is properly:
1. Collected by the frontend
2. Forwarded through the API gateway
3. Received by the job processor
4. No data loss during transmission

Next step: Ensure service-registry and other microservices are properly configured for end-to-end job execution.
