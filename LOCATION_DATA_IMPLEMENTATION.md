# Service Location Data Implementation
**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Overview

Implemented location data for the H3Africa Imputation Service to display geographic information on the Services page (`http://154.114.10.184:3000/services/1`).

---

## Problem

The Services page was displaying "Location: -" because no location data was populated in the database, even though the frontend and database schema were already designed to support it.

---

## Solution

### 1. Database Schema

The `imputation_services` table already had comprehensive location fields:

```sql
location_country     VARCHAR(100)      -- Country name
location_city        VARCHAR(100)      -- City name
location_datacenter  VARCHAR(200)      -- Data center/institution name
location_latitude    DOUBLE PRECISION  -- Latitude coordinate
location_longitude   DOUBLE PRECISION  -- Longitude coordinate
```

### 2. H3Africa Service Location

Based on research and user confirmation, the H3Africa Imputation Service is hosted at:

**Institution**: ILiFU (Inter-university Institute for Data Intensive Astronomy)
**University**: University of Cape Town
**City**: Cape Town
**Country**: South Africa
**Coordinates**: -33.9249°S, 18.4241°E

### 3. Database Update

```sql
UPDATE imputation_services SET
  location_country = 'South Africa',
  location_city = 'Cape Town',
  location_datacenter = 'ILiFU, University of Cape Town',
  location_latitude = -33.9249,
  location_longitude = 18.4241
WHERE id = 1;
```

### 4. API Response

The service registry API now returns complete location data:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "H3Africa Imputation Service",
  "location_country": "South Africa",
  "location_city": "Cape Town",
  "location_datacenter": "ILiFU, University of Cape Town",
  "location_coordinates": {
    "lat": -33.9249,
    "lon": 18.4241
  }
}
```

### 5. Frontend Display

The frontend ([ServiceDetail.tsx:370-380](frontend/src/pages/ServiceDetail.tsx#L370-380)) already had logic to display location:

```typescript
{(service.location_city || service.location_country || service.location) && (
  <ListItem>
    <ListItemIcon>
      <LocationOn />
    </ListItemIcon>
    <ListItemText
      primary="Location"
      secondary={
        service.location_datacenter || service.location_city || service.location_country
          ? `${service.location_datacenter ? service.location_datacenter + ', ' : ''}${service.location_city ? service.location_city + ', ' : ''}${service.location_country || ''}`
          : service.location
      }
    />
  </ListItem>
)}
```

**Display Output**: "ILiFU, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa"

## GA4GH Service-Info Alignment

### GA4GH Standard

The GA4GH Service-Info specification (v1.0.0) defines an `organization` object but does not include physical location fields:

```yaml
organization:
  type: object
  required: [name, url]
  properties:
    name: string         # Organization name
    url: string (uri)    # Organization website
    contactUrl: string (uri)
    documentationUrl: string (uri)
```

### Our Extension

Our platform extends the standard with location fields to support use cases where geographic location matters:

**Why Location Matters**:
1. **Data Residency**: Researchers may need to keep data in specific jurisdictions
2. **Latency**: Geographic proximity can affect upload/download speeds
3. **Compliance**: Some institutions require data processing in specific countries/regions
4. **Transparency**: Users want to know where their genomic data is being processed

**Implementation Strategy**:
- ✅ Core GA4GH fields in `organization` object (name, url)
- ✅ Extended location fields in separate database columns
- ✅ Optional display - only shown when populated
- ✅ Coordinate support for future map visualization

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Map Visualization
Add interactive map showing service locations:
```typescript
// Future: Display services on world map
<MapView services={services} />
```

### 2. Data Residency Filtering
Allow users to filter services by country/region:
```typescript
// Future: Filter by location
<ServiceFilter byCountry="South Africa" />
```

### 3. Network Latency Estimation
Show estimated latency based on user location:
```typescript
// Future: Calculate distance/latency
<LatencyIndicator
  userLocation={userLat, userLon}
  serviceLocation={serviceLat, serviceLon}
/>
```

### 4. Compliance Badges
Display data residency compliance indicators:
```typescript
// Future: Show compliance badges
<ComplianceBadges
  gdpr={true}
  africaCDC={true}
  hipaa={false}
/>
```

---

## Testing

### Verification Steps

1. ✅ Check database update:
```bash
docker exec postgres psql -U postgres -d service_registry_db \
  -c "SELECT location_city, location_country FROM imputation_services WHERE id=1;"
```

2. ✅ Verify API response:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/services/1 | jq '.location_city'
# Output: "Cape Town"
```

3. ✅ Check frontend display:
- Navigate to http://154.114.10.184:3000/services/1
- Verify "Location" section shows: "ILiFU, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa"

---

## Files Modified

### Database
- `service_registry_db.imputation_services` table (service ID 1)

### No Code Changes Required
- Frontend already implemented ([ServiceDetail.tsx](frontend/src/pages/ServiceDetail.tsx))
- Backend already supports location fields
- API already returns location data

---

## Summary

✅ **Problem Solved**: Service page now displays complete location information
✅ **Data Source**: User-confirmed hosting at ILiFU, UCT
✅ **GA4GH Compatible**: Extended standard with useful location fields
✅ **Production Ready**: Live and accessible at service detail page

**Result**: Users can now see that the H3Africa service is hosted at ILiFU, University of Cape Town, South Africa, providing transparency about data location and helping them make informed decisions about service selection.
