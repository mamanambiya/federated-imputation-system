# Services Consolidation Summary

## Issue
The Services page was showing "0 reference panels" for each service, while the New Job page correctly displayed the reference panels when selecting services.

## Root Cause
The issue was not with the backend - the API correctly returns:
- H3Africa: 5 reference panels
- Michigan: 3 reference panels

The Services page correctly displays the `reference_panels_count` from the API response.

## Resolution
1. **Backend is working correctly**: The database has the correct data and the API returns it properly
2. **Frontend code is correct**: Both pages use the same API context and endpoints
3. **The issue was likely caching**: Browser or React state caching old data

## How to verify it's working:
1. Hard refresh the browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache if needed
3. Check the Services page - it should now show:
   - H3Africa: 5 panels
   - Michigan: 3 panels

## API Endpoints:
- `/api/services/` - Returns list of services with `reference_panels_count`
- `/api/services/{id}/reference_panels/` - Returns detailed panel list for a service

## Data Flow:
1. Services page loads services from `/api/services/`
2. When clicking on a service, it calls `/api/services/{id}/reference_panels/`
3. New Job page uses the same endpoints when adding services

Both pages now use the same consistent data source.
