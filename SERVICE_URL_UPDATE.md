# Service URL Update - October 7, 2025

## Summary

Updated the H3Africa Imputation Service URL to the correct domain and verified the service is now accessible.

## Changes Made

### H3Africa Imputation Service (ID: 1)

**Before:**
```
URL: https://h3africa.org/imputation
Status: HTTP 404 (Not Found)
Health: unhealthy
```

**After:**
```
URL: https://impute.afrigen-d.org
Status: HTTP 401 (Requires Authentication - Expected)
Health: healthy
Response Time: 20.168ms
```

## Databases Updated

1. **service_registry_db** (microservices):
   ```sql
   UPDATE imputation_services
   SET base_url = 'https://impute.afrigen-d.org'
   WHERE id = 1;
   ```

2. **federated_imputation** (Django backup):
   ```sql
   UPDATE imputation_imputationservice
   SET api_url = 'https://impute.afrigen-d.org'
   WHERE id = 1;
   ```

## Verification

### Health Check Test
```bash
curl "http://154.114.10.123:8000/api/services/1/health/?force=true"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "service_id": 1,
  "status": "healthy",
  "response_time_ms": 36.549,
  "error_message": null,
  "checked_at": "2025-10-07T21:36:25.350632"
}
```

### Direct URL Test
```bash
curl -I "https://impute.afrigen-d.org"
```

**Result:** HTTP 200 OK - Server responding correctly

## Current Service Status

| ID | Service Name | URL | Health Status | Response Time |
|----|--------------|-----|---------------|---------------|
| 1 | H3Africa Imputation Service | https://impute.afrigen-d.org | ✅ healthy | 20.168ms |
| 2 | Michigan Imputation Server | https://imputationserver.sph.umich.edu | ⏱️ timeout | - |
| 3 | eLwazi MALI Node | http://elwazi-node.icermali.org:6000/ga4gh/wes/v1 | ❌ unhealthy | - |
| 4 | eLwazi ILIFU Node | http://ga4gh-starter-kit.ilifu.ac.za:6000/ga4gh/wes/v1 | ❌ unhealthy | 9.748ms |
| 5 | eLwazi Omics Platform | https://platform.elwazi.org | ❌ unhealthy | - |

## Notes

- The HTTP 401 response from H3Africa service is expected behavior - it indicates the server is online and functioning, but requires authentication for API access
- The health check system correctly interprets 401 as "healthy" because the service is accessible and responding
- Response time of 20ms indicates excellent server performance and network connectivity
- Both current (service_registry_db) and legacy (federated_imputation) databases have been updated to maintain consistency

## Frontend Impact

The updated URL will be reflected in the Services page after the next health check cycle. Users can manually trigger a health check using the "Check Status" or "Force Check" buttons on the Services page.

## Next Steps

If other service URLs need to be updated:
1. Verify the correct URL with the service provider
2. Test the URL manually: `curl -I <url>`
3. Update both databases (service_registry_db and federated_imputation)
4. Force a health check to verify: `curl "http://154.114.10.123:8000/api/services/<id>/health/?force=true"`
