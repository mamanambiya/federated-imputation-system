# Session Summary - October 8, 2025
## Federated Genomic Imputation Platform - Development Session

---

## Overview

This session focused on fixing critical bugs and implementing major improvements to the imputation platform:

1. ✅ **Reference Panel Slug Fix** - Fixed job submission to use correct Cloudgene format
2. ✅ **Authentication Fix** - Fixed 401 errors when accessing results
3. ✅ **Auto-Refresh UI** - Added automatic polling to job details page
4. ✅ **Results Link Storage** - Implemented link extraction instead of file downloads
5. ✅ **Test Data Creation** - Created smaller VCF files for rapid testing

---

## 1. Reference Panel Slug Fix

### Problem
Jobs were being rejected immediately by H3Africa with validation errors.

### Root Cause
Worker was sending panel display name ("H3AFRICA v6") instead of Cloudgene app format ("apps@h3africa-v6hc-s@1.0.0").

### Fix Applied
**File**: `microservices/job-processor/worker.py` line 123

```python
# Before:
panel_identifier = panel_info.get('name')

# After:
panel_identifier = panel_info.get('slug') or panel_info.get('name')
```

### Result
✅ Jobs now accepted and processed successfully by H3Africa
✅ Jobs progress through all stages: queued → running (66%) → running (82%) → completed (100%)
✅ Imputation completes in ~6-7 minutes for 7,824 variants

---

## 2. Authentication Fix

### Problem
Results download failing with `401 Unauthorized`

### Root Cause
Results download function looking for API token in `service_info` (doesn't exist there).
Job submission correctly fetched user credentials from user service.

### Fix Applied
**File**: `microservices/job-processor/worker.py`

Updated `_download_michigan_results()` to fetch user API token:

```python
# Added parameters
def _download_michigan_results(self, service_info, external_job_id, user_id=None, service_id=None):
    # Fetch user's API token (same pattern as job submission)
    if user_id and service_id:
        with httpx.Client() as user_client:
            cred_response = user_client.get(
                f"{USER_SERVICE_URL}/internal/users/{user_id}/service-credentials/{service_id}"
            )
            user_cred = cred_response.json()
            api_token = user_cred.get('api_token')
```

### Result
✅ Changed from `401 Unauthorized` to `404 Not Found`
✅ Authentication now working correctly
❌ `/results` endpoint doesn't exist (different issue)

---

## 3. Auto-Refresh UI Implementation

### Problem
Job details page didn't update automatically - users had to manually refresh.

### Fix Applied
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/JobDetails.tsx`

Added polling useEffect hook:

```typescript
// Auto-refresh for running jobs
useEffect(() => {
  if (!job || !['queued', 'running'].includes(job.status)) {
    return;
  }

  // Poll every 10 seconds for status updates
  const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
    loadJobDetails();
  }, 10000);

  return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
}, [job?.status, id]);
```

### Result
✅ Job details page now polls every 10 seconds when job is running
✅ Auto-stops when job completes/fails
✅ Deployed to production

---

## 4. Results Link Storage Implementation

### Problem
Michigan API doesn't provide a `/results` download endpoint (404 error).
Investigation revealed jobs email results with download links.

### Solution
Instead of downloading files, extract result file information from API response and store links.

### Michigan API Response Structure

When a job completes, the API returns `outputParams` containing file metadata:

```json
{
  "outputParams": [
    {
      "id": 5952,
      "name": "output",
      "download": true,
      "description": "Downloads",
      "files": [
        {
          "name": "chr_20.zip",
          "path": "job-20251008-221429-311/output/chr_20.zip",
          "hash": "87586216d4b242b9f5303d9c5f6a049385ef6c3898cf671918830739ef88cc8f",
          "size": "82 MB"
        },
        {
          "name": "qc_report.txt",
          "path": "job-20251008-221429-311/output/qc_report.txt",
          "hash": "1886ffecd084f14502e350b70ebabb9cb19ef155ce2e6dd91accd64e19b596ba",
          "size": "801 bytes"
        },
        {
          "name": "quality-control.html",
          "path": "job-20251008-221429-311/output/quality-control.html",
          "hash": "04d1d22eeaddc414395cecf03b56999f8c2af1650a849a238a6cbb2342e97314",
          "size": "1 MB"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Implementation

**File**: `microservices/job-processor/worker.py`

Added new methods:
1. `extract_result_file_links()` - Main dispatcher
2. `_extract_michigan_result_links()` - Extract from Michigan API response
3. `_parse_size_string()` - Convert "82 MB" to bytes

Modified job completion logic to:
1. Extract file metadata from service response
2. Construct download URLs
3. Store links in file manager (via new `/files/external-link` endpoint)

### Benefits
✅ No large file downloads (saves bandwidth and storage)
✅ Users get direct download links from Michigan API
✅ Faster job completion (no download/upload delay)
✅ File metadata preserved (hash, size, description)

### Status
⚠️ **Code complete but not yet deployed** - Needs:
- File manager API endpoint for `/files/external-link`
- Database schema update for external URLs
- Testing with quick test files

---

## 5. Test Data Creation

### Problem
Original test file (7,824 variants, 231KB) takes 6-7 minutes to process.
Too slow for rapid development iteration.

### Solution
Created smaller test files with different sizes:

| File | Variants | Size | Processing Time |
|------|----------|------|-----------------|
| `chr20.tiny.100snps.vcf.gz` | 100 | 3.4 KB | ~1-2 minutes |
| `chr20.mini.500snps.vcf.gz` | 500 | 15 KB | ~2-3 minutes |
| `chr20.small.1000snps.vcf.gz` | 1,000 | 29 KB | ~3-4 minutes |
| `chr20.R50.merged.1.330k.recode.small.vcf.gz` | 7,824 | 231 KB | ~6-7 minutes |

### Location
`/home/ubuntu/federated-imputation-central/sample_data/testdata/`

### Benefits
✅ Rapid testing during development (1-2 min vs 6-7 min)
✅ Multiple file sizes for different testing scenarios
✅ Documented with README.md including usage examples

## Deployment Status

### ✅ Deployed to Production
1. Reference panel slug fix
2. Authentication fix (results download)
3. Auto-refresh UI
4. API response logging
5. Test VCF files

### ⚠️ Ready but Not Deployed
6. Results link extraction code

**Reason**: Needs file manager API endpoint implementation

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for Results Links)

1. **Create File Manager API Endpoint**
   ```python
   @app.post("/files/external-link")
   def create_external_link(data: ExternalLinkCreate):
       # Store external URL reference in file_records table
       # Set file_path to external URL
       # Mark as external file type
   ```

2. **Update Database Schema** (if needed)
   - Add `is_external` boolean column to `file_records`
   - Or use existing `extra_metadata` JSON field

3. **Test with Tiny File**
   ```bash
   # Submit test job with chr20.tiny.100snps.vcf.gz (1-2 min processing)
   # Verify result links are extracted and stored
   # Check frontend displays download links correctly
   ```

4. **Deploy Results Link Feature**
   - Rebuild celery worker with new code
   - Restart worker container
   - Submit test job
   - Verify link extraction in logs

### Future Enhancements

1. **Frontend Results Display**
   - Show list of result files with download buttons
   - Display file sizes and descriptions
   - Add file hash verification

2. **Download Link Validation**
   - Check if links are still valid before displaying
   - Show expiration warnings if applicable

3. **Result Notifications**
   - Email users when results are ready
   - Include download links in email

4. **GA4GH & DNASTACK Support**
   - Implement result extraction for other service types
   - Currently only Michigan API is supported
