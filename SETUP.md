# Federated Imputation System - Setup Guide

## Current Status

The federated imputation system has been designed and the basic project structure is in place. However, we're experiencing network connectivity issues that prevent Docker builds from completing successfully.

## Project Structure

```

## What's Working

✅ **Database & Redis**: PostgreSQL and Redis containers are running successfully
✅ **Django Models**: Complete data models for imputation services, jobs, panels, etc.
✅ **Django Views**: REST API endpoints with ViewSets for all major operations
✅ **Celery Tasks**: Asynchronous task definitions for job processing
✅ **React Frontend**: Complete frontend structure with Material-UI components
✅ **Service Integration**: Base classes for H3Africa and Michigan service integration

## Current Issue

**Network Connectivity**: Docker builds are failing due to timeouts when accessing package repositories (PyPI, Debian). This appears to be a network connectivity issue on the current system.

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Fix Network Issues
1. Diagnose and resolve network connectivity issues
2. Run: `sudo docker-compose build web`
3. Run: `sudo docker-compose up`

### Option 2: Manual Setup
1. Install Python 3.11 and Node.js locally
2. Set up virtual environment
3. Install dependencies manually
4. Run Django development server
5. Run React development server

### Option 3: Use Minimal Setup
1. Run only DB and Redis: `sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.minimal.yml up -d`
2. Set up Django on host system connecting to containerized services

## Quick Start (When Network Works)

```bash
# Start all services
sudo docker-compose up -d

# Run migrations
sudo docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate

# Create superuser
sudo docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser

# Load initial data
sudo docker-compose exec web python manage.py loaddata initial_services.json

# Access the application
# Django API: http://localhost:8000/api/
# React Frontend: http://localhost:3000/
# Django Admin: http://localhost:8000/admin/
```

## Key Components

### Django Backend (Port 8000)
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/services/`, `/api/jobs/`, `/api/panels/`, etc.
- **Admin Interface**: `/admin/` for managing services and jobs
- **Models**: ImputationService, ReferencePanel, ImputationJob, etc.

### React Frontend (Port 3000)
- **Dashboard**: Job statistics and overview
- **Services**: Manage imputation services and panels
- **Jobs**: Create, monitor, and manage imputation jobs
- **Results**: Download and manage result files

### Services
- **PostgreSQL**: Database (Port 5432)
- **Redis**: Message broker and cache (Port 6379)
- **Celery**: Background task processing
- **Celery Beat**: Scheduled task management

## API Integration

The system is designed to integrate with:
- **H3Africa Imputation Service**: For African population reference panels
- **Michigan Imputation Service**: For general population reference panels

## Development Notes

- Fixed indentation error in `imputation/views.py`
- Created environment configuration in `docker-compose.override.yml`
- All models and serializers are complete
- Frontend components are fully structured
- Service integration classes are ready for implementation

## Resume Instructions

When network connectivity is restored:
1. Run `sudo docker-compose build --no-cache`
2. Run `sudo docker-compose up -d`
3. Follow the Quick Start guide above
