# Reference Panel Slug Fix - Success Report
**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: ✅ SUCCESSFUL - Core Bug Fixed

## Summary

The reference panel identifier bug has been successfully fixed. Jobs are now being accepted and processed by H3Africa, proving the slug fix is working correctly.

## The Bug

**Problem**: Jobs were being rejected immediately by H3Africa due to incorrect reference panel identifier format.

**Root Cause**: The job processor was sending the panel's `name` field ("H3AFRICA v6") instead of the `slug` field ("apps@h3africa-v6hc-s@1.0.0").

**Location**: `microservices/job-processor/worker.py` line 123

## The Fix

```python
# Before (incorrect):
panel_identifier = panel_info.get('name')

# After (correct):
panel_identifier = panel_info.get('slug') or panel_info.get('name')
```

The H3Africa Cloudgene API requires reference panels in the format: `apps@{app-id}@{version}`

This format is stored in the database's `slug` field, not the `name` or `display_name` fields.

## Test Results

### Test Job 1: Failed Validation (Before Fix)
- **File**: testdata_chr22_48513151_50509881_phased.vcf.gz
- **Build**: hg38
- **Panel Sent**: "H3AFRICA v6" (display name - incorrect)
- **Result**: Rejected in < 1 second (validation error)
- **External ID**: job-20251008-205019-206

### Test Job 2: Successful Imputation (After Fix)
- **File**: chr20.R50.merged.1.330k.recode.small.vcf.gz (231 KB)
- **Build**: hg19
- **Panel Sent**: "apps@h3africa-v6hc-s@1.0.0" (slug - correct ✓)
- **Job ID**: 9b4fd298-b31b-4b21-8eac-ff4bd2226aca
- **External ID**: job-20251008-212019-866
- **Result**: ✅ **IMPUTATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

#### Progress Timeline:
- 21:20:19 - Job submitted to H3Africa
- 21:20:20 - Accepted (HTTP 200 OK)
- 21:23:12 - Running at 66% progress
- 21:26:34 - Running at 82% progress
- 21:26:53 - Completed at 100% (6 minutes 34 seconds total)

### Current Status: Results Download Issue

The job completed successfully on H3Africa's end, but failed when attempting to download results:

```
Error: Client error '401 Unauthorized' for url
'https://impute.afrigen-d.org/api/v2/jobs/job-20251008-212019-866/results'
```

**This is a separate issue from the slug bug** - it indicates:
1. ✅ The slug fix is working perfectly (job was accepted and processed)
2. ❌ Results endpoint requires different/additional authentication
3. 💡 May need a password or job-specific token to download results

## Deployment

### Containers Rebuilt and Restarted:
1. `federated-imputation-job-processor:latest`
2. `federated-imputation-central_celery-worker:latest`

### Verification:
```bash
# Verified correct code in running container:
docker exec federated-imputation-central_celery-worker_1 grep -n "panel_identifier" worker.py
# Output: panel_identifier = panel_info.get('slug') or panel_info.get('name')
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Investigate H3Africa Results Authentication
The results endpoint may require:
- A job-specific download password
- Different authentication headers
- Results may be emailed instead of via API
- OAuth or session-based authentication

### 2. Check H3Africa Documentation
Review H3Africa/Michigan Imputation Server API docs for:
- Results download authentication methods
- Whether results are available immediately or via email
- Any additional credentials needed for file downloads

### 3. Alternative: Email-Based Results
Many imputation servers (including Michigan) send results via email notification with download links. Consider:
- Checking if H3Africa emails results to the API token owner
- Implementing webhook/notification handler for result availability
- Polling a different endpoint for result status

## Conclusion

✅ **PRIMARY OBJECTIVE ACHIEVED**: The reference panel slug bug has been fixed and verified working.

Jobs are now:
- Accepted by H3Africa (no validation errors)
- Processing correctly through all stages
- Completing imputation successfully

The results download issue is a **separate authentication concern** that needs investigation of H3Africa's specific requirements for retrieving completed job outputs.

---

**Recommendation**: Mark the slug fix as complete and create a separate task for implementing proper H3Africa results retrieval based on their API documentation or support guidance.
