# Complete Solution: Manual Containers → Docker Compose

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: Manual containers don't restart after system reboot → services offline → frontend appears empty

**Root Cause**: Containers created with `docker run` lack restart policies and configuration is not in version control

**Solution Delivered**:
1. ✅ **Immediate Fix** (DONE): Added restart policies to all running containers
2. ✅ **Permanent Fix** (READY): Docker Compose configuration matching production + migration scripts
3. ✅ **Documentation** (COMPLETE): Comprehensive guides and incident reports

| `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` | Step-by-step migration instructions | ✅ Created |
| `WHY_MANUAL_CONTAINERS.md` | Complete root cause analysis | ✅ Created |
| `SYSTEM_RESTART_INCIDENT_REPORT.md` | Incident documentation | ✅ Created |

### 2. Migration Scripts ✅

| Script | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `scripts/migrate_to_compose.sh` | Automated migration | ✅ Created |
| `scripts/rollback_migration.sh` | Automated rollback | ✅ Created |

### 3. Immediate Fixes Applied ✅

```bash
# All containers now have restart policies
docker update --restart=unless-stopped \
  federated-imputation-central_api-gateway_1 \
  federated-imputation-central_user-service_1 \
  federated-imputation-central_service-registry_1 \

## Why This Happened (Simple Explanation)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ The Timeline                                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 1. System originally used docker-compose      │
│                                                 │
│ 2. During debugging sessions, services were    │
│    restarted manually with docker run          │
│                                                 │
│ 3. Manual containers worked → shipped to prod  │
│                                                 │
│ 4. Docker-compose.yml never updated            │
│                                                 │
│ 5. Manual containers = no restart policy       │
│                                                 │
│ 6. System rebooted at 00:20 this morning       │
│                                                 │
│ 7. Only postgres & redis restarted             │
│    (they have restart policies)                 │
│                                                 │
│ 8. All microservices stayed down                │
│                                                 │
│ 9. Frontend couldn't reach backend              │
│    → appeared empty                             │

**Not a data problem - an infrastructure problem** ✅

## Two-Path Solution

### Path A: Keep Running As-Is (Current State)

**What you have now:**
- Manual containers with restart policies added
- System will survive reboots
- Everything working

**Pros:**
- ✅ Zero risk
- ✅ No downtime
- ✅ System is stable

**Cons:**
- ❌ Configuration not in version control
- ❌ Hard to reproduce on new server
- ❌ Manual container management

**Recommendation**: Good for short-term ✅

---

### Path B: Migrate to Docker Compose (Recommended)

**What you'd get:**
- All services managed by docker-compose
- Configuration in version control
- Professional deployment
- Easy to reproduce

**Pros:**
- ✅ Configuration as code
- ✅ Single command operations
- ✅ Easy to scale
- ✅ Industry standard

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ ~2 minutes downtime during migration
- ⚠️ Requires testing

**How to do it:**
```bash
# Simple one-command migration
sudo ./scripts/migrate_to_compose.sh

# If anything goes wrong
sudo ./scripts/rollback_migration.sh
```

**Recommendation**: Do this in next maintenance window 🎯

---

## Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Recommended Path | Reason |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| Production system, can't afford downtime | Keep Path A | Zero risk |
| Have maintenance window available | Migrate to Path B | Long-term benefit |
| Moving to new server soon | Migrate to Path B | Will need compose anyway |
| Testing/staging environment | Migrate to Path B | No downtime concern |

## What To Do Next

### Immediate (Next 5 Minutes)

1. ✅ **Verify system is working**
   ```bash
   # Check services
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/services/

   # Test frontend
   curl http://154.114.10.184:3000
   ```

2. ✅ **Test reboot resilience** (optional)
   ```bash
   # Reboot and wait 5 minutes
   sudo reboot

   # After reboot, check services
   docker ps
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/services/
   ```

### Short-term (This Week)

1. ⚠️ **Review documentation**
   - Read [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](./MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
   - Review [WHY_MANUAL_CONTAINERS.md](./WHY_MANUAL_CONTAINERS.md)
   - Understand [SYSTEM_RESTART_INCIDENT_REPORT.md](./SYSTEM_RESTART_INCIDENT_REPORT.md)

2. 🎯 **Plan migration**
   - Pick a maintenance window (15 minutes needed)
   - Inform users of brief downtime
   - Have rollback plan ready

### Medium-term (This Month)

1. ✅ **Execute migration to docker-compose**
   ```bash
   sudo ./scripts/migrate_to_compose.sh
   ```

2. ✅ **Verify and clean up**
   - Test all functionality
   - Remove old backups after 1 week
   - Update documentation

### Long-term (Ongoing)

1. 🚀 **Adopt Docker Compose workflow**
   - All changes via compose file
   - No more manual `docker run`
   - Version control everything

2. 📊 **Add monitoring**
   - Set up health check monitoring
   - Alert on service failures
   - Track uptime metrics

3. 🔄 **Set up CI/CD**
   - Automate testing
   - Automate deployment
   - Automated rollbacks

## Key Takeaways

### Technical Lessons

1. **Restart policies are critical** - Without them, containers don't survive reboots
2. **Manual containers → technical debt** - They work but aren't sustainable
3. **Configuration should be code** - Version control is essential
4. **Network configuration matters** - Services need correct network setup
5. **JWT secrets must sync** - All auth services need same secret

### Operational Lessons

1. **Quick fixes accumulate** - Each `docker run` added to the problem
2. **Documentation is essential** - We could reconstruct config from docs
3. **Backups save everything** - Data was never at risk
4. **Testing matters** - Should have caught this before reboot
5. **Automation prevents incidents** - Compose would have prevented this
