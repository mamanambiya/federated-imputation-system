- `DATA_LOSS_PREVENTION.md` - Data protection strategies
- `AUTOMATED_MONITORING_SETUP.md` - Monitoring system configuration
- `COMPREHENSIVE_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md` - Recent improvements summary

### Key Procedures
- **Daily Backups**: Automated at 2:00 AM
- **Health Checks**: Continuous monitoring
- **Recovery**: Step-by-step restoration guides
- **Performance**: Optimization recommendations

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Directory (`architecture/`)

### Technical Documentation
- `DJANGO_FASTAPI_ARCHITECTURE.md` - **Comprehensive guide to Django + FastAPI hybrid architecture**
  - Why both frameworks? Performance comparison and use cases
  - 7-database architecture explained (database-per-service pattern)
  - ILIFU service connection deep dive
  - Django Admin & microservices integration (current gaps and solutions)
  - Data synchronization challenges and future patterns
- `DJANGO_REACT_ARCHITECTURE_FIX.md` - Architecture improvements and fixes

### Quick Reference
- **Architecture Overview**: `architecture/ARCHITECTURE_CONTEXT.md` - 30-second overview and troubleshooting

### System Design
- **Backend**: Django REST Framework (admin, auth) + FastAPI microservices (async operations)
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and Material-UI
- **Queue**: Celery with Redis
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose (7 microservices + infrastructure)
- **Databases**: 7 PostgreSQL databases (database-per-service pattern)

### Key Architecture Decisions
- **Hybrid Framework**: Django for admin/UI, FastAPI for performance (10x faster health checks)
- **Microservices**: 7 independent services with isolated databases
- **Async Operations**: FastAPI native async for concurrent external service health monitoring
- **Memory Efficiency**: 75% less RAM than all-Django (300 MB vs 1.2 GB for microservices)

### Issue Resolution
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - **Comprehensive troubleshooting guide** for common issues
- `LOGIN_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Authentication issue debugging
- `TESTING_RULES.md` - Testing guidelines and best practices

### Common Issues
- Authentication failures
- Database connectivity
- Service integration problems
- Performance bottlenecks

## üöÄ Quick Start for Developers

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd federated-imputation-central

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Run initial setup
./post_change_validation.sh
```

### 2. Development Workflow
```bash
# Install backup system
./dev_docs/scripts/backup_scheduler.sh install

# Run comprehensive tests
./dev_docs/scripts/run_comprehensive_tests.sh

# Monitor system health
./post_change_validation.sh
```

### 3. Testing Workflow
```bash
# Run Playwright tests
cd dev_docs/tests
npx playwright test

# Run API tests
./dev_docs/scripts/run_comprehensive_tests.sh api

# Run performance tests
./dev_docs/scripts/run_comprehensive_tests.sh performance
```

## üìä Monitoring and Alerts

### Health Checks
- **System Validation**: `./post_change_validation.sh`
- **Backup Status**: `./dev_docs/scripts/backup_scheduler.sh status`
- **Service Health**: Check services page for real-time status

### Key Metrics
- System uptime: >99.9%
- API response time: <2 seconds
- Backup success rate: 100%
- Test pass rate: >90%

## üîê Security Considerations

### Development Security
- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Regular security scans and updates
- Follow secure coding practices

### Production Security
- Implement proper authentication
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Regular backup verification
- Monitor for security incidents
