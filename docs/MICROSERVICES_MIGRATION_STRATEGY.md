## 🔄 Data Migration Strategy

### **1. Database Migration**
```sql
-- Create service-specific databases
CREATE DATABASE user_management_db;
CREATE DATABASE service_registry_db;
CREATE DATABASE job_processing_db;
CREATE DATABASE file_management_db;
CREATE DATABASE notification_db;
CREATE DATABASE monitoring_db;

-- Migrate data with referential integrity
-- User data migration
INSERT INTO user_management_db.users 
SELECT * FROM federated_imputation.imputation_user;

-- Service data migration
INSERT INTO service_registry_db.imputation_services 
SELECT * FROM federated_imputation.imputation_imputationservice;
```

### **2. Data Consistency Strategy**
- **Eventual Consistency:** For non-critical data synchronization
- **Strong Consistency:** For financial and audit data
- **Saga Pattern:** For distributed transactions
- **Event Sourcing:** For audit trails and job history

### **3. Data Synchronization**
```python
# Example synchronization script
async def sync_user_data():
    """Sync user data between services."""
    users = await get_users_from_monolith()
    for user in users:
        await user_service.create_or_update_user(user)
        await audit_service.log_migration(user.id, 'user_migrated')
```

## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation

### **1. Rollback Strategy**
```bash
# Quick rollback to monolith
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
./scripts/restore_database_backup.sh
./scripts/update_dns_to_monolith.sh
```

### **2. Circuit Breakers**
- Implement circuit breakers for service calls
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Fallback to cached data when possible

### **3. Monitoring and Alerting**
- Real-time monitoring of all services
- Automated alerts for service failures
- Performance degradation detection
- Capacity planning alerts
