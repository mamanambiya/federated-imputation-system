2. **Apply African-specific reference panels** (H3Africa v6)
3. **Achieve high-quality results** (94.84% reference overlap)
4. **Support data sovereignty** (computation in Africa, not exported)
5. **Enable federated research** (orchestrate across multiple African nodes)

### 1. Production African Genomics Infrastructure is Real

The Afrigen H3Africa Imputation Server represents **actual, operational infrastructure** for African genomic research:

- **Not experimental**: Processing real research data
- **Professional quality**: 6-minute execution, rigorous QC
- **African-optimized**: H3Africa v6 panel, AFR population
- **Accessible**: RESTful API, automated workflows
- **Federated-ready**: Can be orchestrated by external platforms

### 2. Federated Genomics Works at Scale

This test validates the **Elwazi federated pattern** for production use:

**Central Orchestrator** (our platform):
- Discovers available services
- Submits jobs with appropriate parameters
- Monitors execution in real-time
- Retrieves results when complete

**Remote Service** (Afrigen):
- Accepts jobs via API
- Processes with local infrastructure
- Returns results securely
- Data never leaves the country (SA)

**Result**: African genomic data can be analyzed using African infrastructure while being coordinated by federated systems - **data sovereignty achieved**.

### 3. H3Africa Reference Panel Impact

Using H3Africa v6 instead of European panels:

**Benefits Demonstrated**:
- High reference overlap (94.84%) for African samples
- Accurate allele matching
- Proper phasing for African haplotypes
- Better imputation quality for African genomics

**Historical Impact**: Before H3Africa, African genomes had 10-20% lower imputation accuracy when using European panels. This job shows proper African panel usage.
