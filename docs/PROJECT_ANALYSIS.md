# Project Analysis: Federated Genomic Imputation Platform

## Overview

This is a comprehensive web-based platform for genomic imputation that connects researchers to multiple imputation services (H3Africa, Michigan Imputation Server, and others). It's a federated system allowing users to submit genomic data processing jobs while maintaining data sovereignty.

## Architecture

### Backend (Django REST Framework)

- **Models**: Comprehensive data models including:
  - User management with role-based access control (UserRole, UserProfile)
  - Service management (ImputationService, ReferencePanel, ServiceConfiguration)
  - Job processing (ImputationJob, JobStatusUpdate, ResultFile)
  - Permission system (ServicePermission, ServiceUserGroup)
  - Audit logging (AuditLog)
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for services, jobs, panels, results, and user management
- **Task Queue**: Celery with Redis for async job processing
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistent storage

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)

- **UI Framework**: Material-UI components
- **Routing**: React Router v6 with auth-based route protection
- **State Management**: React contexts (AuthContext, ApiContext)
- **Key Pages**: Dashboard, Services, Jobs, Results, User Management
- **Features**: File upload, real-time job tracking, service selection

### Infrastructure

- **Containerization**: Docker Compose orchestrating 6 services:
  - PostgreSQL database
  - Redis cache/queue
  - Django web server
  - Celery workers
  - Celery beat scheduler
  - React frontend
- **Deployment**: Ready for cloud deployment with health checks

## Key Features

1. **Multi-Service Support**: Integration with multiple genomic imputation services through standardized APIs (Michigan, GA4GH, DNASTACK)

2. **Reference Panel Management**: Dynamic syncing of reference panels from external services with population-specific options

3. **Job Workflow**: Complete job lifecycle management from file upload through processing to result download

4. **User Management**: Sophisticated RBAC with roles (Admin, Service Admin, Researcher, Service User, Viewer)

5. **Service Discovery**: Geographic awareness for data sovereignty, service health monitoring

6. **Security**: Authentication, authorization, audit logging, API key management

## Supported Formats

- Input: VCF, PLINK, BGEN genomic data formats
- Max file size: 100MB (configurable)
- Genome builds: hg19, hg38

## Current Status

- Version 1.0 with 5 active services
- 24 reference panels covering African, European, and global populations
- Production-ready with comprehensive documentation
- Future roadmap includes OAuth integration, workflow orchestration, and AI-powered service selection

The platform successfully bridges multiple genomic imputation services through a unified interface while maintaining security, scalability, and user-friendly operation.
