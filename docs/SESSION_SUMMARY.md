# Session Summary - October 3, 2025

## Overview
This session involved fixing critical issues with service health monitoring and user authentication in the Federated Genomic Imputation Platform.

## Major Issues Resolved

### 1. Services Showing "Unknown" Status ✅
**Problem**: All services displayed "Unknown" status instead of "Offline" when timing out.

**Root Cause**: Frontend didn't recognize "timeout" status returned by Service Registry microservice.

**Solution**:
- Updated `Services.tsx` to map "timeout" status to "unhealthy" for display
- Frontend now shows: `status === 'unhealthy' || status === 'timeout'`

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/pages/Services.tsx`

### 2. H3Africa Imputation Service Offline ✅
**Problem**: H3Africa service showed as offline despite being operational.

**Root Causes**:
1. Incorrect URL: `https://h3africa.org/imputation` (doesn't exist)
2. Correct URL: `https://impute.afrigen-d.org/`
3. Missing logic to handle Michigan-style HTTP 401 responses
4. SQLAlchemy relationship error preventing service registry from starting

**Solutions**:
1. Updated service URL in PostgreSQL database (`service_registry_db`)
2. Added Michigan-style health check logic (HTTP 401 = healthy)
3. Fixed SQLAlchemy model: Added `ForeignKey("imputation_services.id")` to `ReferencePanel.service_id`
4. Rebuilt and restarted service-registry container

**Files Modified**:
- `microservices/service-registry/main.py`
  - Added `ForeignKey` import
  - Added `ForeignKey` constraint to ReferencePanel model
  - Health check logic already existed for Michigan-type APIs

**Database Changes**:
```sql
UPDATE imputation_services
SET base_url = 'https://impute.afrigen-d.org/'
WHERE id = 7;
```

**Key Insight**: For Michigan-style imputation servers (Michigan, H3Africa/AfriGen-D):
- HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) = **Service is HEALTHY** ✅
- HTTP 404 (Not Found) = Endpoint doesn't exist ❌
- Timeout/Connection refused = Service offline ❌

### 3. Login Failure - Network Connection Error ✅
**Problem**: Users couldn't log in, getting "Network connection error" message.

**Root Causes**:
1. **Rate Limiting**: IP address hit 100 requests/hour limit (made 381 requests)
2. **Content-Length Header Conflicts**: API Gateway proxy forwarding caused HTTP errors
3. **HTTP 307 Redirects Not Followed**: FastAPI trailing slash redirects not handled
4. **Missing curl**: api-gateway container health checks failing

**Solutions**:

#### Immediate Fix:
```bash
docker exec redis redis-cli DEL "rate_limit:105.242.149.5"
```

#### Long-term Fixes:
1. **Rate Limiting** - Increased from 100 to 1000 requests/hour for development
2. **HTTP Proxy** - Fixed Content-Length header conflicts:
   - Removed problematic headers from requests: `host`, `content-length`, `transfer-encoding`
   - Removed problematic headers from responses: `content-length`, `transfer-encoding`
3. **Redirect Handling** - Enabled `follow_redirects=True` in httpx client
4. **Health Checks** - Added curl to api-gateway Dockerfile

**Files Modified**:
- `microservices/api-gateway/Dockerfile`
  - Added curl installation
- `microservices/api-gateway/main.py`
  - Increased rate limit: `limit: int = 1000` (was 100)
  - Added redirect following: `httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=30.0, follow_redirects=True)`
  - Removed problematic headers from requests
  - Removed problematic headers from responses

**Container Status**:
- ✅ api-gateway: Now showing as "healthy"
- ✅ service-registry: Now showing as "healthy"

### 4. Login Redirect Loop ✅
**Problem**: After successful login, users redirected back to `/login` instead of dashboard.

**Root Cause**: Login component used `location.state?.from?.pathname` which could be `/login` itself when users navigated directly to the login page.

**Solution**: Always redirect to `/` (dashboard) after successful login, regardless of where user came from.

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx`
  - Removed `location.state?.from` logic
  - Hardcoded redirect to `'/'` (dashboard)
  - Simplified useEffect dependency array

## Documentation Created

### TROUBLESHOOTING.md ✅
Comprehensive troubleshooting guide covering:
- Login issues (rate limiting, network errors)
- Service health status issues (Unknown status, offline services)
- Rate limiting management
- Container health debugging
- Common commands reference
- Database queries
- Redis cache management

## Testing Performed

### Login Endpoint ✅
```bash
curl -X POST http://154.114.10.123:8000/api/auth/login/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"test_user","password":"test_password"}'

# Returns: JWT token + user data ✅
```

### H3Africa Health Check ✅
```bash
curl http://154.114.10.123:8000/api/services/7/health/

# Returns: {"status": "healthy", "response_time_ms": 12.177} ✅

## Key Learnings & Best Practices

### 1. Always Update Memory After Major Changes ⭐
**Reminder**: After completing significant work:
1. Commit changes to git with descriptive messages
2. Update/create documentation (README, TROUBLESHOOTING, etc.)
3. Test all affected functionality
4. Document learnings and solutions

### 2. Michigan-Style API Health Checks
Michigan Imputation Server and derivatives (H3Africa/AfriGen-D) require authentication:
- HTTP 200 = Healthy (authenticated request)
- **HTTP 401 = Healthy** (service online, rejecting unauthenticated request)
- HTTP 404 = Unhealthy (endpoint doesn't exist)
- Timeout = Unhealthy (service offline)

### 3. HTTP Proxy Header Management
When proxying HTTP requests, remove these headers to avoid conflicts:
- `host` - causes routing issues
- `content-length` - recalculated by proxy
- `transfer-encoding` - conflicts with content-length

Always enable `follow_redirects` for proxies handling FastAPI apps (trailing slash redirects).

### 4. Rate Limiting Strategy
Development vs Production:
- **Development**: 1000 requests/hour (avoid lockouts during testing)
- **Production**: 100-200 requests/hour (security)

Store in Redis with key pattern: `rate_limit:{IP_ADDRESS}`

### 5. Login Redirect Pattern
After successful authentication, always redirect to a fixed destination (dashboard):
- ❌ Don't use: `location.state?.from` (can create loops)
- ✅ Do use: Hardcoded `'/'` or specific route

### 6. SQLAlchemy Relationships
Bidirectional relationships require:
- `relationship()` on parent model
- `ForeignKey()` on child model's foreign key column
- `back_populates` on both sides

## Files Changed Summary

### Frontend
- ✅ `frontend/src/pages/Services.tsx` - Timeout status handling
- ✅ `frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx` - Redirect fix

### Microservices
- ✅ `microservices/api-gateway/Dockerfile` - Added curl
- ✅ `microservices/api-gateway/main.py` - Rate limit + proxy fixes
- ✅ `microservices/service-registry/main.py` - SQLAlchemy fix

### Documentation
- ✅ `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - New comprehensive guide
- ✅ `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Database
- ✅ `service_registry_db.imputation_services` - H3Africa URL updated

## Next Steps / Recommendations

1. **Monitor Rate Limiting**: Check if 1000 req/hour is sufficient for development
2. **Test Login Flow**: Verify redirect works from browser
3. **Monitor H3Africa**: Verify it stays healthy over time
4. **Consider**: Adjust rate limits based on usage patterns
5. **Document**: Update main README with new troubleshooting guide reference

## Commands for Quick Reference

### Clear Rate Limit
```bash
docker exec redis redis-cli DEL "rate_limit:{IP}"
```

### Check Service Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/services/7/health/
```

### Restart Container
```bash
docker restart api-gateway
```

### View Logs
```bash
docker logs api-gateway --tail 50
```

### Test Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"test_user","password":"test_password"}'
```
